<h1>Who</h1>
Hi I'm Hannah (<a href="http://twitter.com/hancush">@hancush</a>) and I'm a realtime/social media reporter/editor for the Midwest at the Associated Press. 

I decided to learn Python on a lark in July, then I thought, oh well I ought to incorporate this into my job, so I thought up this tool that vacuums up x hours of tweets from a Twitter list timeline, scores them based on stuff I think is important and spits back the top 10. 

The list here is meant to be a proxy for a community, but I estimate I could probably do a similar thing for search results or location data (declared in bio or embedded in tweets or maybe even inferred from tweets).

Maybe you have ideas, too. Tweet me. 

<h1>Why</h1>
Part of my job is training, but Rome wasn't built in a day, so I wanted to find a way to empower a broader swath of people to spot stories on social without having to grasp all the idiosyncrasies of the Twitter interface/community.

<h1>In sum</h1>
Really this is all a big learning exercise, but that's the engine that's driven this whole pursuit: realizing what can be done, asking how, and then setting out to do it yourself.

If you read all that, forreal tweet me.
