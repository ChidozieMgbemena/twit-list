<h1>Why</h1>
Part of my job is training, but Rome wasn't built in a day, so I wanted to find a way to empower a broader swath of people to spot stories on social without having to grasp all the idiosyncrasies of the Twitter interface.

As an aside, I've chosen Twitter because both its API and Python libraries for communicating with it are well documented, its full archive is available, and it contains all sorts of data that can be sliced, diced, visualized and/or served up in all sorts of ways.

<h1>What</h1>
I intend to build a dashboard that will highlight tweets receiving most engagement (replies, retweets, favorites, weighted in that order) over x period of time from members of y list; all the user would have to do is specify what list, and what period of time.

The list here is meant to be a proxy for a community, but I estimate I could probably do a similar thing for search results, location data (declared in bio or embedded in tweets) or maybe even keywords from bios.

There might also be a way to incorporate viz after the baseline search and return script/web app is complete--but that's another repo!

<h1>How</h1>
This undertaking is sort of huge for someone who only has a background in HTML/CSS, so best to go step at a time.

First, I am picking up Python as my first scripting language via Learn Python The Hard Way and supplementing lessons I don't quite "get" by reading the Python documents, questions on StackOverflow and Python-related subreddits.

I will assemble the backend script in Python incrementally by breaking it down into steps and trying to figure out how to make those steps work one at a time.

Once I've got a script that does what I want it to locally, I will learn and use JavaScript to stick it up on the web for wider use.

<h1>In sum</h1>
Really this is all a big learning exercise and I'm hoping the more I learn about the capabilities of each language, the better my ideas will be... but I think that's the big part of this: realizing what can be done, asking/learning how, and then setting out to do it yourself.
